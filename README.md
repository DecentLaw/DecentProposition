# DecentProposition

In this set of files, we will explain that the solution to legal friction and opacity and the solution to participatory rule-making are connected, and in plain site.  And that it will help to use plain language to explain this. We propose to express this in common language, without invention.  That is to say, to have generative language systems contribute all of the text.  And, to prove that the LLM has not invented, that it should directly quote sources.  That is, the entire explanation should be sourced from the original expression of the idea by a human.  Borrowed, quoted, clipped and linked, not massaged or masked, by the LLM or the humans who have said more or less the same thing, less perfectly.

In this, we will demonstrate that the necessary ideas are well-known, old, few.  And if there is anything original here, it is in fitting these things together in a particular way.  Shaping the surfaces of these ideas a particular way, an interface. Even the interface is a selection of a few old interface ideas.  And probably the selection is not new, merely overlooked, i.e., not yet widely distributed.
